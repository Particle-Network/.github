# Particle Network

**One account. One balance. Any chain.**

Particle Network powers **chain abstraction** through its **Universal Accounts**. These provide users with a single account for the entire Web3 ecosystem, eliminating the need to bridge, switch networks, and manage multiple wallets or gas tokens.

If youâ€™re building in Web3 and tired of fragmented UX and liquidity, Universal Accounts are for you.

**All of this is possible thanks to the Particle Chain, an L1 blockchain acting as the coordination layer for account abstraction across chains.**

## What can I build?

With Universal Accounts, you can build apps where:

- Users have a combined balance, spendable in one goâ€”even if they deposit tokens from multiple chains or even hold different stablecoins.
- Anyone can deposit assets from any chain.
- UX feels like a Web2 app, even while powered by 10+ chains in the background.
- Cross-chain logic (e.g. payments, mints, asset transfers) is handled at the account level.
- Your smart contracts can interact with users from any network through a unified account layer.

ðŸ‘‰ This works with the tools youâ€™re already using â€” ethers, wagmi, etc.

## Quick integration steps

Integrating Universal Accounts is fairly simple:

1. Set up your auth method.
2. Initialize the Universal Accounts SDK.
3. Fetch the universal address.
4. Build and send UserOperations using any supported chain.
5. Done. Your app is now chain-agnostic.

## Supported chains

Universal Accounts support almost all EVM chains AND Solana, with more chains being added constantly.

To users, this means two primary addresses.

## **Social logins & account abstraction**

Beyond Universal Accounts, Particle Network also provides tools to facilitate onboarding UX:

- **Social logins** â€“ Allow your users to create an in-dApp wallet by logging in with Google, Apple, email, and other Web2 accounts. No seed phrases, no friction.

- **Account abstraction** â€“ Leverage account programmability by powering gasless transactions, smart accounts, and programmable user wallets.

These tools work independently or alongside Universal Accounts to make Web3 feel as easy as Web2.

## TL;DR for devs

If you want to let users:

- Log in once.
- Have a combined account and balance for all chains.
- Just enjoy your app.

Then you want **chain abstraction**.

You want **Universal Accounts**.
