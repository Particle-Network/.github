# Introduction

**Particle Network** is a Modular L1 Powering Chain Abstraction. Particle Network's modular L1 blockchain powers chain abstraction and coordinates Universal Accounts across chains, abstracting away wallets, gas, and unifying liquidity. It acts as a universal settlement layer, empowering existing L1s, L2s, and non-EVM blockchains through account coordination.

## Products

### Connect Service

**Particle Connect** is the SSO for web3. We help you onboard both Web2 & Web3 users **seamlessly, securely & user-friendly.**

### Auth Service

**Particle Auth** provides MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based threshold signatures.

With threshold signatures, each party creates an independent key. They then forge the vault’s lock together in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key.

Our security is unlike any other auth/wallet service: it's better. Complex passwords and long seed phrases, browser extensions, and special hardware are no longer required for log-in. Instead, accounts are secured by industry-leading TSS implementation and KMS encryption.

[👉 Learn more about how we implement this 🔐](https://developers.particle.network/docs/security-mpc-tss)

With Particle Auth integrated into your dApp, users can log in within seconds. By removing seed phrases, we can increase conversion rates by up to 64% for both new and Web3.0 users.

### BTC Connect

**BTC Connect** is the first account abstraction protocol for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

BTC Connect implements a smart account, Paymaster, Bundler, and unique Bitcoin-specific modal for unified utilization of smart accounts on supported EVM chains (such as Merlin, BEVM, bSquared) through the means of native Bitcoin wallets (such as UniSat, Xverse, etc.).

### Wallet Service

**Particle Wallet** provides a one-stop wallet solution, which is easy to use but powerful and safe.

We've included detailed designs in our wallet service to create the ultimate user experience. By integrating Particle Wallet with a one-line code, we help you provide users with token and NFT-related functions, transaction and payment processes, as well as other operations to deliver a first-class user experience.

### Node Service

**Particle Node** provides a robust, secure, and highly available blockchain API.

Not only do we have JSON-RPC support, but also enhanced API. This allows you to receive transaction information and NFTs through addresses, obtain token prices, smartly encode/decode transactions, and more. Compared to other node services, you develop your dApp faster while also ensuring that it performs better.
