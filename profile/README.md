Particle Network: The Modular L1 for Universal Accounts

Particle Network is a modular Layer 1 blockchain that unifies all chains through Universal Accounts, achieving "One Account, One Balance, Any Chain" to solve Web3’s user and liquidity fragmentation issues.

It powers chain abstraction by coordinating Universal Accounts across chains, abstracting away wallets, gas, and liquidity fragmentation. Acting as a universal settlement layer, it empowers existing L1s, L2s, and non-EVM blockchains through account coordination.
